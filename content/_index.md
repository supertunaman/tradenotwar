TradeNotWar.info is aimed at developing peace through capital philanthropy and consumer opportunities. That is, **sending money and buying stuff**. In every developing economy, there are small businesses that just need a microloan to acquire new inventory or equipment, or some extra revenue to expand the business. TradeNotWar.info's Conscious Capital Directory connects every day consumers and individuals with these opportunities. As [research](https://peacepolicy.nd.edu/2016/05/18/linking-development-and-peace-the-empirical-evidence/) shows, economic development is directly linked to peace. By availing these developing economies to capital, we -- and you -- can create a more peaceful world.
